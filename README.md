## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size



### Links

- Live Site URL: https://costelloeward.github.io/testimonials-grid/](https://costelloeward.github.io/testimonials-grid/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Using flex nested within grid for the photo positioning

### Continued development

When and why to move on from an initial design to get a more accessible product. Altered position of the quote mark image for readability.



### Useful resources

- [On using alt text](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/06/img-alt-attribute-alternate-description-decorative/) - This helped me use more nuanced descriptions for my alt text. I really liked this perspective.
